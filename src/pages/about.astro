            <p>I've always liked technology since I was a kid, I like to look at games, and think about how things work. but unfortunately at that time, I wasn't close to computers (they didn't support it). I like art and visual images, I used to love drawing paper and including my drawings (calligraphy), until I just saw the cracks in the wall, and my imagination explored.</p>
            <p>I started to know computers massively in internet cafes in junior high school in 2007, often internet every time I came home from school, watched youtube, and liked to survive on the internet, but not until maniacal online games. at that time I didn't know how to make a website either.</p>
            <p>When I was in high school + after 3 years at the boarding school, I started holding a Symbian cellphone and liked to modify the appearance of the cellphone starting with themes, icons, and widgets. started learning a little python language just for display scripting. learned to write blogs sharing Symbian applications (illegal) and entered internet forums.</p>
            <p>At the end of the year at the boarding school (2016) I was able to buy a cheap HP brand laptop for 1 million with intel dual core specs. starting at that time I learned HTML, and CSS from the internet (website articles) and continued to learn programming at a non-formal boarding IT school like the boarding school. There I learned many things about the vast and complex world of software engineering. 
              Learning HTML, CSS, PHP, Python, WordPress, and Laravel until learning Odoo ERP. At that time I also began to recognize Linux and was very enthusiastic about using Linux, tweaking, and exploring it.</p>
            <p>In 2017, I finally bought a decent laptop with AMD A9 spec and 4GB RAM and started working at a B2B ticketing startup. At that time I was familiar with the Linux OS and I used it daily, it was so powerful that I only used WM because it was to increase laptop performance.
              I learned a lot about the fast-growing javascript programming ecosystem, especially React and Vue frameworks, even though the technology where I worked was still using legacy technology.
              I enjoy working as a Frontend Developer until now and designing app interfaces that are pleasing to the eye and functional in experience.</p>
            <p>I like to explore the development of technology, especially web technology, read programming articles, watch programming videos, and participate in technology forums. Continue to learn to improve logic and problem-solving to become a relevant software engineer according to technological developments.</p>
            <p>Currently, I focus on becoming a Fullstack Developer and Product Designer which I think is relevant to what I like üòÉ.</p>
